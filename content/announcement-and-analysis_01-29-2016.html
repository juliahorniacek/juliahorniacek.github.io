        <h1>Announcement and Analysis</h1></a>
    <h4>{January 29, 2016}</h4>

        From the perspective of a college graduate, the real world can be a scary place. On the one hand, you feel free.
        No more homework assignments to hand in, exams to study for or campus rules to follow. But the reality settles in
        like a rough hangover once summer ends, September begins, and those back-to-school commercial jingles no longer apply to you.

        I remember graduation like it was yesterday (and considering it was just shy of two years ago, I should). We lined up according to school,
        and it felt so natural to group together with my fellow literature majors. We snapped group selfies, reminisced on the happenings of the weekend before,
        purposely avoiding talking of the future. Over 800 students, and those three hours just seemed to fly on by.

        It poured after the ceremony. A sea of maroon, white, and black caps scrambled to find their families, take pictures with mom and dad,
        and say goodbye to friends, most of whom we wouldn't actually be seeing soon. Empty promises? Wishful thinking?

        My parents, sisters, God mother, Nana, and I went out for brunch afterwards. Mark and I lost track of one another that day and separated to go
        with our families. As my eyes fixated on my coffee cup -- a chip here, a stain there -- my mind wandered to my next move. Our next move.
        My career. My relationship. For the first time since my minor breakdown mid apartment packing, I was scared.

        There were a handful of roadblocks from that day until now. I picked up a few part time jobs in between internships that barely paid enough
        to cover my hour-long commute. I mulled over alternative options every other week. I could enroll in a masters program and become a professor,
        get my middle school education degree and gush over YA until retirement. There were so many windows of opportunity to give up, but I was
        fortunate enough to have the unconditional support of my parents and boyfriend, my sisters and best friends.

        I am so excited to announce that I have been promoted from freelance to full time Beauty Editor for <a href="http://bestproducts.com">BestProducts.com</a>,
        three months earlier than the standard evaluation period. Hard work absolutely pays off, and even though this industry can feel practically impossible
        to break into (I applied to Hearst Magazines a whopping 18 times alone before landing BestProducts), I truly believe what you put out into the universe
        you will get back. Life is kind when you let it be. I am madly in love with the man who's asked me to be his wife, I am slightly obsessed with my job,
        and have the best friendships I could have asked for found both among family members by blood and by heart. I'm not quite sure life could get any better,
        and I'll just sit back and enjoy the ride.
