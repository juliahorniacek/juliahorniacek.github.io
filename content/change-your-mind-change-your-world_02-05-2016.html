    <h1>Change Your Mind, Change Your World</h1></a>
    <h4>{February 05, 2016}</h4>
    <p>
        We're taught from a young age to stand up to our bullies, to face our demons head on. But there are so many days I wake up my own enemy.
        I am still figuring out how to stand up to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Joining Crush60 was a step in the healthy direction physically, but it was also an attempt to get an even tighter grip on my healthy mindset
        because, truthfully, I fluctuate between loving every bit of my body, to suffering in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've dealt with body image dysmorphia for as long as I can remember. I can back track to a moment in high school, trying on clothes in a
        dimly lit Hollister fitting room. I had a panic attack over the tight fit of a pink halter top with a gorgeous floral pattern.
        I looked at myself in the mirror, juggling tears on my eyelids so my mom wouldn't see, disappointed at my reflection. This went on until
        junior year of college, when one disorder transitioned into another. As a result of starving myself, restricting my food intake to 600-900
        calories a day, I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. I was scared of food and the red numbers flashing, mocking me from the scale below
        my feet. What frightened me most was how addicting the counting became. How consumed I was with eating less, working out more, and
        watching my body shrink.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I met Mark, I was at my worst. It takes a strong person to stay by someone with an eating disorder because we can be volatile. We hate
        ourselves, so we take it out on others, and negativity spreads like the plague. Mark, though, is such an amazing man. When we went out to eat,
        he sat patiently waiting while I grappled over what to order. He reminded me that I was not only beautiful on the outside, but on the inside as well,
        and that we would get through this together. Having him as a shoulder to cry on has only made us stronger as a couple. With his support, I was
        able to see myself through a different lens, and by the time graduation rolled around, I was dedicated to recovery. I cannot thank him enough.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently, I've been falling back into self doubt, harsh criticisms, and micro managing meals. I've somehow convinced myself that not working out
        4-5 times a week is taboo, that eating sweets will eventually result in disaster, and therefore an evil cycle has formed in which I am
        constantly disappointed by my actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a mind game I do not want to play.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is my reality: I walk 50 blocks a day from the train to my office and back. I make an effort to do some sort of alternative workout
        if I cannot make it to the gym. I've combined Crush60 with Jillian Michael's Killer Abs and Pilates. I eat extremely healthy 90% of the time,
        and allow myself to indulge on the weekends. I am not writing this to justify my habits. I am writing this to tell my story, and maybe inspire others
        who are suffering as well to recognize their behavior, to remind them that they are more than their scars.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am stronger than my mental illness and I have the fantastic support system of my future husband, my parents, and friends to keep me grounded.
        There will come a time when I'll stop to think about how silly it was to argue with myself over whether or not to eat a second piece of toast.
        I'll stop feeling guilty about indulging in too much chocolate on those days where you just need it. I'll look in the mirror and like what I see
        more than a few days in a row. I have all the tools, I have those who love me, and I have the determination to get me there.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are too many of us hurting behind closed doors and judging ourselves for not measuring up to this or that expectation; for not looking like
        the models on magazine covers or actresses on television. I'm not here to tell you recovery is easy. I'm not here to tell you not to feel the pain.
        In fact, I'm telling you to accept your pain, but try your best to channel it into something positive. If it weren't for the lows of my eating
        disorder, I would never have reveled in the highs of an excellent workout. Our bodies are capable of change, but so are our minds.
    </p>
    <p>
        It seems that everything in life circles back to that one simple fact. Change your mind, change your world.
