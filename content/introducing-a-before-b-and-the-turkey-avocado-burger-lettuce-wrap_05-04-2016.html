    <h1>Introducing A before B and the Turkey Avocado Burger Lettuce Wrap</h1></a>
    <h4>{May 04, 2016}</h4>
    <p>
        Last week officially marked the halfway point in my Crush 60 program. I realize from the reader's perspective, 
        especially if you follow me on Instagram or Twitter, it probably feels like I've actually been doing Crush for 
        much longer than 30 days. Technically, this would be correct, but due to my hectic work schedule and by the time I make 
        it home from the city, my weekly routine does not follow this program from day to day.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have capped off Mondays and Wednesdays from 6:30 - 7:15pm specifically for Crush shenanigans. It's easier for me to head to the gym 
        after work when my Dad's going as well. We've kind of become each other's motivation - never underestimate the power of a gym buddy!
    </p>
    <p>
        Tuesdays and Thursdays vary. I'll admit to slacking quite a bit lately on days I don't go to the gym, but during a good week 
        I'll either do some form of cardio or a Jillian Michael's Killer Abs session in my living room. I also love to do Yoga stretches 
        before calling it a night, just to relax my body. Fridays and Sundays are rest days, and on Saturdays I head over to Crunch Fitness 
        with my fianc√© for an arm and shoulders routine we've by now coined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I have a nice balance. I like to keep things interesting in my workouts, so switching it up a few times a week is really 
        important (and keeps me dedicated!). However, with my wedding less than a year away, and how addicted I've become to seeing 
        results in my body, I will be incorporating a new routine into my schedule. You'll see me start to change things up as the months 
        go on, but I'm pretty excited to tell you about my first.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've created a program that I refer to as A before B, or Abs before Bed. Sundays through Thursdays I will dedicate 15 minutes before bed 
        to a mini series of ab workouts.

            <li><strong>15 raised-legs crunches</strong></li>

        It's common knowledge within the fitness community that you cannot spot reduce, but unlike other muscles, the abdominal can be put to work 
        every day of the week, if you so choose. Right now I'm focused on incorporating minor adjustments to my workout regime, and eventually see 
        them become habit. I am excited to see how my body progresses with even this slight change. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of changes, let's talk food! I'm excited to share my second recipe with you all, as it was a huge hit with the future hubby. 
        Mark is extremely appreciative when I cook pretty much anything, but it gave me such satisfaction to have him go out of his way to say 
        how much he really loved this meal. 
    </p>

        I was searching through <a href="http://www.delish.com" target="_blank">delish.com</a> when I came across an easy recipe for turkey burgers. 
        It was a humid Friday, and a juicy burger sounded amazing, but not only am I trying to save bucks by cooking dinner instead of buying it, 
        I'm also trying to be healthier on the weekends. So when I proposed the recipe to Mark, I was inspired by his suggestion of swapping out the 
        bun for lettuce leaves. And so the Turkey Avocado Burger Lettuce Wrap was born, and it was mmm-mmm good.

        There was no real pretty way to take a picture of this meal, but trust me, visuals are irrelevant. It's all in the taste. First, 
        I brought the stove to medium heat, sprayed the pan with cooking spray, and placed two Butterball Turkey Burger patties into the pan. 
        As they cooked, I mashed up one whole avocado, splitting it evenly to spread over each wrap. Before taking the patties off the pan, 
        I laid one slice of American cheese on each, allowing that to melt over the top of the meat. I had Mark cut two big leaves of lettuce 
        for the wraps, and placed each burger patty on top of the leaves, encompassing the full patty.  To make sure every bite offered a balance 
        of turkey and avocado, I spread the mashed contents over the actual patty itself, before spreading the remaining avocado onto the lettuce directly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> You could also cut up the burger patty to create smaller wraps for an appetizer when entertaining! 
        It was delicious, nutritious, and is a Mark-approved meal. I'll consider this a win in my book (and a staple go-to dinner in the future).
