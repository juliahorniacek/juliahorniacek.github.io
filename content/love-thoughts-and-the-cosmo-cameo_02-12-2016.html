    <h1>Love Thoughts &amp; The Cosmo Cameo</h1></a>
    <h4>{February 12, 2016}</h4>
    <p>
        As I sit typing this entry, I find myself comfortably tired. This week has been one of the busiest since the holiday season,
        and next week will be part two. Even though I've been falling asleep on my backroom couch around nine o'clock every night this
        week, and my body is sore from new workouts, I'm not sure I've ever been happier.

        Tuesday has been, by far, my most favorite day in February. Mark and I worked with the video team at
        <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com" target="_blank">Cosmopolitan.com</a> on a couples' video in which
        Mark was transformed into my '90s heartthrob (guess who). During the interview process, we were asked a few times whether or not
        we believe this experience would bring us closer together. At first, "yes" came as an instinctive answer, because doesn't every experience
        bring two people who love each other closer together? After mulling it over for a bit, my answer is still yes, but for a different reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mark is the most important thing in my life. When we first started dating, I was so scared of that becoming the case. That another human
        would become so important to me, that I would be terrified to lose them, to hurt them, or for them to hurt me. But Mark has always
        been different. I know as long as I live, I will not lose him. He is my love, my life partner, my best friend. The reason something like
        the Cosmo shoot brought us closer together is not solely because it was something fun to do, but it was, in a way, a symbolic part of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from the fact that my family and friends mean the world to me, my career and fitness have become priorities in my life. I loved
        having Mark with me at the office. I loved every part of signing our consent forms, talking about silliness like school girl
        celebrity crushes, and getting on camera together for the world to see us as a unit. I loved that he was immersing himself in a huge
        part of my world. It brought us closer together because it was a blast, but it also brought us closer together because it gave him
        a peek inside my universe. You and your significant other may be two completely different people, but there is nothing better than the
        joy of seeing one another doing what you love, and getting a taste of each other's world.

        This weekend we will be looking at two more wedding venues, and I'm hoping to find our venue once and for all. We still have one more
        after this weekend, but I'm crossing my fingers for love at first sight. I'll keep you all up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'd also love if YOU kept ME up to date. Do you have makeup questions for me? Product recommendations? Tutorial requests? I'd love to know
        what you'd like me to incorporate in blog posts to come. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/julia.horniacek" target="_blank">Let me know on Facebook!</a>
