    <h1>Making the Switch: From IIFYM to Intuitive Eating</h1></a>
    <h4>{July 1, 2016</h4>
    <p>
        During junior year of college, my body became a target of a cyber bullying. Though I'd never considered my self esteem 
        to be particularly high prior to the incident, it only took one tweet for it to completely spiral out of control. Suddenly 
        the gym became a security blanket, and food became the enemy. 
    </p>

        I'm open regarding my body image issues and my recovery from anorexia nervosa, and have previously mentioned my latest endeavor 
        on the journey of tracking macros in order to maintain my body weight. Unfortunately, counting macros has become just as much of 
        an obsession as counting calories had been at school. I'm constantly on my phone, planning out every single bite, focusing on meeting 
        however many grams of carbs, proteins, and fats throughout the day, to the point where days blurred together in a fixation of food, 
        and little else.

        Recently Mark and I suffered the loss of our loved ones, and, of course, this put things into perspective, as these things often do. 
        I've come to realize that death can bring great sadness, but it can also bring clarity, motivation, determination. I've mulled over my 
        creative motives over the past week, but I've also begun digesting my issues with food, with my body, and where I want to go from here. 
        I can tell you where I don't want to end up. I do not want to give into the downward spiral of an eating disorder again. There is so much 
        more to life than counting calories, micromanaging macros, and plugging numerical data into a smart phone application to find peace of mind. 
        This is not sanity. Instead, it can become robotic, and in sensitive cases, like my own, can become destructive.

        Mark and I went to dinner a few nights ago. It was a very nice restaurant/bar with leather seats and flat screens all over flashing NBA coverage 
        and the news. I was excited to be out with him, and to have a nice meal. It had been a long day, and I was very hungry. The wait staff was friendly 
        and as our hostess seated us in a comfortable booth with a smile, she handed us our menus and I opened up to the list of dinner options. 
        All I saw was a list of calories.
    </p>
    <p>
        My hunger vanished as soon as I saw them all, listed beside each meal's description. Calories in the high 700s to 1K. There was no food, 
        only numbers, and I would be consuming them. I panicked, grew quiet, and he knew. Mark looked over at me and told me it was okay, to focus 
        on the food, and the fact that I was hungry and needed a good meal. It was his encouragement and warm support that brought me back to a recent 
        vlog I had watched from Crushfit member and Instagram personality <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenbretty/" target="_blank">jenbretty</a>, 
        in which she expressed what "intuitive eating" meant to her, and how she had made the switch from IIFYM to her new lifestyle. I ordered my grilled 
        chicken and avocado sandwich, taking the time to check in with my body and recognize when I was full. I ended up having leftovers on the plate. 
        I felt satisfied, not overly full, and had enjoyed the meal, eating what I enjoyed from my plate, and felt good about it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Before breakfast the next morning, Mark sat playing video games as I snuggled into his computer chair, logging on to Youtube, 
        and watched Jen's video once more. This time I was not only listening to her words, but doing my best to understand them. Intuitive eating 
        is not a diet, is not a plan to lose weight or gain weight. It is a lifestyle. It is a mentality. It is the conscious decisions you make with 
        your food by honoring your body. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I eat healthy naturally. I prefer to fill up on chicken, fish, veggies, and fruit throughout the day and enjoy dessert at the end of the day. 
        I practice moderation, and make sure to incorporate a balance of the good stuff with the sweet stuff. I do not need macros to instruct me on 
        how to eat. I already know how to do that and am able to recognize when I've eaten too many carbs, when I am need of protein, and which fats 
        will benefit my body. Now that I have put this into practice, and I have experienced tracking macros, I made the decision to stop counting.
    </p>
    <p>
        I truly believe tracking macros is an excellent resource that teaches us how to recognize what we are putting into our bodies, and the benefits 
        of certain foods versus other foods. I have a better understanding of diet than ever before. I also agree that, for those looking to lose weight, 
        it is an excellent program to follow. I am not pledging my allegiance to intuitive eating and turning up my nose at tracking macros. If it works 
        for you, that is amazing, and I will be the first to admit that it had worked for me, physically. Mentally, however, this is not something I need 
        to participate in. At least not now.
    </p>
    <p>
        On June 17th, I deleted My Fitness Pal from my phone. It has been three full days of intuitive eating, and I find myself satisfied, full, and 
        happier. Of course, I'm no expert. Three days in isn’t all that impressive I suppose, but I've felt mentally stronger than I have in a while. 
        My mind is beginning to ease up. I find myself in a good place, an exciting place, almost like a clean slate, and am excited to share my journey 
        with you.
