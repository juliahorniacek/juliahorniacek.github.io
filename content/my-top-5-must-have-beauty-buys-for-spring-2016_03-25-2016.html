    <h1>My Top 5 Must-Have Beauty Buys for Spring 2016</h1></a>
    <h4>{March 25, 2016}</h4>
    <p>
		Friends! Birds are chirping in the morning, the sun still hangs around past five o'clock, and rising temperatures are granting 
		me the opportunity to wear a skirt and not freeze on my way to work! Spring is officially upon us, which means we're moving 
		on from winter essentials, and introducing a new batch of seasonal beauty staples.        
    </p>
	<p>
        As a beauty editor, I work with handfuls of products, and I can assure you that, so far, this spring looks promising in terms of 
        product launches. Granted, we're barely a week into the season, I'm breaking down the top five thus far that have improved 
        my beauty regimen by far.

            <strong>1. MAC Prep + Prime Fix+</strong>
            <br/>
            $22, <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/13825/32212/Products/Skincare/Primers/Prep-Prime-Fix" target="_blank">http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/13825/32212/Products/Skincare/Primers/Prep-Prime-Fix</a>

            OK, so technically this isn't brandy new, but I'm kicking off my must-haves with a classic. I was actually introduced to the 
            multi-purpose mist during a Jaclyn Hill makeup tutorial way back when, and I've lusted over it for months and months. 
            I was finally able to get my hands on a bottle, and it was love at first spritz. Seriously. You can opt to spray over a bare face 
            for a boost of hydration (its brilliant blend of chamomile, cucumber, and gren tea is ultra-moisturizing), mist over a full face 
            of makeup to prolong wear, or wet shadow brush bristles to transform matte powder into a metallic finish.

            <strong>2. Garnier Micellar Bi-Phase Water</strong>
            <br/>
            $7, <a href="http://www.target.com/p/garnier-skinactive-micellar-bi-phase-cleansing-water-13-5-oz/-/A-49109399" target="_blank">http://www.target.com/p/garnier-skinactive-micellar-bi-phase-cleansing-water-13-5-oz/-/A-49109399</a>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My mom and sisters often kid about my A.M. raccoon eyes. I wasn't always a pro makeup remover before bed, and when I wasn't failing at 
            washing it all off, I forgot to even start the process, falling asleep with a full face. Once I started working in the beauty industry, 
            I'd gotten better, but still, liner and mascara bits lingered. This lead to an "it's not me, it's you" decision against my 
            then-staple makeup remover wipes. Since the split, I've experimented with a few alternatives, but none that work like this 
            liquid charm. It's an oil-free, water-based solution that is actually strong enough to wash away every powder and cream, even waterproof 
            mascara and thick gel liner! Garnier's got itself a winner here.

            <strong>3. Pixi Beauty Sleep Cream</strong>
            <br/>
            $24, <a href="http://www.target.com/p/pixi-beauty-sleep-cream-1-18-fl-oz/-/A-49128229" target="_blank">http://www.target.com/p/pixi-beauty-sleep-cream-1-18-fl-oz/-/A-49128229</a>

            I recently visited MAC's Manhattan Studio for a tutorial with regional makeup artist Ashley DiSarro, and aside from the fact that the experience 
            was beneficial in terms of content, I learned a lot about my skin. First of all, I was wearing way too much makeup. My morning line-up was comprised of 
            primer, foundation, concealer, sculpting powder, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, brow powder, brow gel. I was dolling myself up on the daily, 
            following along with YouTube and Insta models to look the part of a beauty guru. In retrospect, this was a wake up call. 
            <br/><br/>
            Beauty mavens care about makeup, but they also care about their skin, and I was focusing heavily on the former, and less on the latter. This is a mistake, 
            and a common one at that. My skin was dry, and needed a lot of hydration before we dove into the cosmetic portion of the tutorial. This was when I made 
            the conscious decision to start moisturizing my skin every night.
            <br/><br/>
            Enter Pixi's Beauty Sleep Cream, my go-to for I-woke-up-like-this flawless skin. Made with mango butter, lavender, lemon, and bergamot, the cream quickly 
            absorbs into the skin, and works throughout the night to deliver a healthier complexion by morning.

            <strong>4. BECCA Cosmetics Backlight Priming Filter</strong>
            <br/>
            $38, <a href="http://www.beccacosmetics.com" target="_blank">http://www.beccacosmetics.com</a>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Once I found a moisturizer that worked for my skin, I sought out products that would not only provide me with enough coverage and nourishment so that I could 
            cut out additional product, but makeup that made me feel comfortable in doing so. I had been so used to masking my natural face, that I wasn't entirely sure I liked 
            what was underneath all the concealer and contoured features. Now I embrace that less is actually more, and there are days I skip foundation and wear BECCA's primer solo. 
            It is a lightweight formula that veils the skin, illuminating its natural beauty while correcting impurities. I was sold at first wear, and you will be too!

            <strong>5. NADS Facial Wax Strips</strong>
            <br/>
            $6, <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/Nad-s-Facial-Wax-Strips-20-count/21186594" target="_blank">http://www.walmart.com/ip/Nad-s-Facial-Wax-Strips-20-count/21186594</a>

            Say goodbye to your local salon. NADS strips are heaven sent for those of us who aren't exactly running to get our eyebrows waxed. I was definitely on the fence 
            about this one at first. I looked over the package, examined the wax, and was taken back to seventh grade when a 13-year-old Julia buzzed off half of her 
            left eyebrow with an electric trimmer. But this, my friends, is different. You are in total control. The applicator pen makes it easy to glide the wax over problem areas. 
            Once wax is in place, smooth the wax strips and pull off. It's literally salon service at home! This will save you time and money. Yes. Please.
