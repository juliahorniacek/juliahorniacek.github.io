        It took a lot of physical, and mental, ups and downs to get me where I am today. As much as I would love to attribute my slim body solely to eating
        healthy and exercise, a big part of my weight loss the first time around was the result of my illness. We joke that this is the upside, but there
        isn't really a positive to the negative it brings into my life. The burden it has on my day to day routine. How quickly I can miss a train, a deadline,
        moments, due to my own body turning against me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please do not misunderstand me. I am grateful that my condition is not as bad as it could be, but the bad days are still very bad, and making
        the conscious effort not to take the good days for granted can be hard during those periods.

        I was discussing my most recent struggles with a friend earlier this afternoon. This past Monday I checked into my local surgery center for
        an endoscopy. This would be my third procedure in five years as an attempt to make better sense of what was going on inside of me.
        Thankfully the doctors were able to nail down the root of my extreme cases over the past few weeks, but digestive disorders are often
        open-ended questions left unanswered. We found a temporary cure to a temporary problem. We did not find every missing piece to the
        jigsaw puzzle that is my anatomy. On Monday I will be officially diving into the Crush Fitness program and, especially taking the last
        few weeks of sharp pains and almost pathetic crying into consideration, I could not be more determined.

        I was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome at the age of 20, but my first "episode", as I call them, took place when I was only ten
        in the middle of my Nana's birthday party at Red Lobster. My whole body started to shake and I had intense pain in my lower abdomen. I started to cry
        and the party was rushed back to my house so that I could excuse myself to the bathroom for at least an hour. Mentally, I was embarrassed and confused.
        Physically, I was sore and exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oftentimes people don't like to talk about illness having to do with digestion and such because it's "bathroom talk", and haven't we been told
        growing up that what happens in the bathroom is a "private matter?" But when you're stuck on a highway with no rest stop in sight or a crowded
        airplane with the seat belt light demanding your patience, and all you feel is pain intensifying through your intestines against your skin,
        and you're struggling to control yourself from exploding or screaming, it is no longer a "private matter."

        The gym used to be a one-stop-shop to skinny in my mind. I ran mile after mile to burn calorie after calorie so that I could look thin and feel pretty.
        But joining Crush is about more than the toned arms and abs (though Aubernutter's Instagram pictures were quite the selling point). Crush
        symbolizes strength. It symbolizes the stronger body I am to build so that when I find myself struggling, my body pulls through, and is
        strong enough to protect me.

        No one wants to be the girl with a disease. I can remember those grueling moments after dinner or before a big meal, trapped in pain, begging God
        and the universe that my stomach aches were something I could outgrow. That my body would stop punishing me for eating. Needless to say, it's been a
        rollercoaster these past ten years full of ups and a handful of downs that brought me very, very low. But I've come to accept a few things here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
        The truth is that I will never be the 5'10" supermodel with voluminous blonde locks and legs for days, and I may never be 100% healthy. But I will
        stand tall at 5'2" with a big heart and eyes that change color. I will build a body that is strong enough to fight harder for me. To quote John Mayer,
        I will be bigger than my body gives me credit for. This is the first step, and I cannot wait to share my progress with you.
