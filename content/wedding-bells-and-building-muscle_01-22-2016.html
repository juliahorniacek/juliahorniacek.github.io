        <h1>Wedding Bells and Building Muscle</h1></a>
    <h4>{January 22, 2016}</h4>
    <p>
        Sunday marked the official start to wedding planning for Mark and I. Around 1:30 we made the trip to The Tides Estate and were
        blown away almost instantaneously. The ballroom was dream-like, and all I could imagine was walking down the grand staircase
        next to my future husband.

        Of course, this was only the first venue we've seen, so my parents didn't hesitate to remind us not to get attached just yet.
        Though I will admit, it's hard not to fall in love with the first venue you visit (unless it's really not what you expected), because
        wedding venues are meant to be fantasy-like. They are meant to be magical. They sell you on it with aesthetically pleasing decoration and
        architecture, and if you talk to the right person who is enthusiastic about the site, you're basically ready to sign the contract then and there.

        Hopefully we will be taking our second tour on our search this Sunday, if weather conditions allow. I could not be more opposed to snow if I tried.
        The plan is to have a venue booked by the end of February, and I'd like to keep the appointments coming. The sooner we set a date, the better.

        The rest of sunday was full of wedding bell chatter. The venue, the date, the ceremony. My mind revolved around becoming Mrs. Guerra. The more
        we plan, the harder it is to wait. But checking out the venue sparked intense fitness motivation. Sweating for the dress would start the next day.

        I was off for Martin Luther King's birthday, so where did I go after shopping and breakfast with the parentals? The gym. iBooks opened to the Crush60
        workout guide, I officially became a CrushFit chick, and it felt fantastic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Getting back to the gym was invigorating, but to be there with a set goal in mind felt even better. Not to mention addicting. I was back on
        Tuesday, and again on Wednesday working my arms, back, abs and legs. Taking a rest this evening due to a work event in Herald Square, I notice the
        (satisfying) soreness in my underarms, back, and legs, and I feel accomplished. I feel strong. I feel determined.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can feel my body getting stronger, even after just a few days, and despite feeling unsatisfied with my appearance one hour to the next in between rushes
        of contentment, I tell myself to shake it off, that it is all in my head, and that I know my body is growing and changing. I am proud of the work I
        put into my body. I should always be proud of what I am getting out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many exciting things are unfolding, and I am embracing each day and what it has to offer. I have no room in my mind, body, or soul for negativity.
        Change your thoughts, change your world. It's not just a turn of phrase. These are words to live by.
    </p>
    <p>
        Change your thoughts, change your world.
