    <h1>Weighing It Out: Fitness &amp; Food</h1></a>

    <p>
        Hello, friends!
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm sorry it has taken me quite a bit to update you all on my wedding planning / fitness progress / 
        beauty shenanigans. Between my first in-person celebrity interview, throwing myself into a new 
        creative writing project, and all while balancing out a social life, things have gotten a bit hectic 
        in my world! But today I wanted to talk to you about the major progression I've noticed in myself and 
        fitness goals over the past two weeks.
    <p>
    <p>
        So first, let's talk about A before B. If you missed my last post, here's a tiny recap. Every Sunday through 
        Thursday night I have dedicated roughly 10-15 minutes before bed to an abdominal workout (get it? A before B?). 
        I have just completed my third week, and can honestly say I'm seeing gradual results! Obviously, three weeks 
        is not going to make a huge difference, but 15 days into the process of a challenging sequence of 5-6 core 
        workouts mixed into my daily routines is definitely a bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've also decided to give tracking macros another shot. As of now, I'm not taking it so seriously. If I meet them, 
        awesome! If I go over, or am short, it's not a big deal. I'm just trying to figure out what works for me in terms of 
        overall body fat percentage loss. I currently weigh 105 lbs, and I'm perfectly happy at this weight, but the goal 
        is to turn a majority of my body fat into toned muscle. It hasn't been easy to solidify a workout schedule that 
        correlates with work, but lately things just seem to be coming together, and I wanted to share with you guys 
        what I do on a daily basis to make sure I stay in shape.

        <ul>
            <li>Monday: Walk to work from Penn Station (25 blocks), walk to Penn Station from work (25 blocks). Roughly 
                amounts to 40 minutes of cardio. Once I get home I head over to the gym and 
                do a Crush workout for 40 minutes, and then A before B!</li>
            <li>Tuesday: Walk to work from Penn Station (25 blocks), walk to Penn Station from work (25 blocks). Roughly 
                amounts to 40 minutes of cardio. Depending on how I'm feeling, I may do a Jillian Michaels ab or yoga 
                workout, but if not, A before B!</li>
            <li>Wednesday: Walk to work from Penn Station (25 blocks), walk to Penn Station from work (25 blocks) 
                Roughly amounts to 40 minutes of cardio. Once I get home I head over to the gym 
                and do a Crush workout for 40 minutes, and then A before B!</li>
            <li>Thursday:Walk to work from Penn Station (25 blocks), walk to Penn Station from work (25 blocks). 
                Roughly amounts to 40 minutes of cardio. Thursday is my pamper day! So after dinner 
                I'll run a nice bubble bath, perform my skincare routine, do a sheet mask and paint on a fresh 
                manicure. If it's been a particularly busy week, Iâ€™ll relax my mind with 15-20 minutes of yoga. 
                A before B!</li>
            <li>Friday: Aside from the expected cardio, Friday is my rest day!</li>
            <li>Saturday: I finally have the chance to let my body catch up on some Z's, which means waking up at 
                8 instead of 5:30. Mark and I usually head over to the gym for an arm/shoulder workout for a good 
                40 minutes. The weather is starting to get nice, so we'll probably do anything in our power to not 
                be cooped up in the house (i.e. hiking!)</li>
            <li>Sunday: My second rest day, with A before B.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        So basically, I'm a busy bee, minus the whole sitting at a desk through work thing, but ever since we started 
        filming segments for Facebook live, and with the warm weather, I try to move more at work. Anyway, I decided that 
        since I'm so dedicated to the fitness part of my physical health and body goals, I figure sweating for the wedding 
        should coincide with eating for the wedding. Enter: IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros).
    </p>
    <p>
        I've tried this technique before, and I think I had the concept a little backwards, at least for my specific goals. 
        I was friends with a guy who was a die-hard iifym trainer, and though he followed macros to a T, he didn't 
        necessarily eat healthy. To me, following macros is allowing yourself the flexibility to have a treat at some point 
        throughout the duration of the day, but having the majority of meals confused me a lot of the healthy stuff. 
        I told myself that, for now, counting macros would be done loosely. I will not allow myself to become obsessed with 
        counting / getting my percentages perfect. Once I reach six months before my wedding, that's when this lifestyle will 
        become stricter.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far so good on the experimental front! Coming from 1000-1100 calories to 1500 calories may not seem like a big 
        difference, but for my tiny stomach it was. I was afraid that eating more would cause me to gain weight, but I've 
        never felt happier, healthier, and fuller since my eating disorder consumed me years ago. After only having been 
        tracking for two and a half weeks, I've noticed a slight difference in my way of thinking about food. I haven't 
        mentally punished myself in weeks for eating a donut or candy. I'm acknowledging my growth, and am genuinely 
        proud of myself for the healthy lifestyle I've built for myself, and looking forward to building upon the 
        foundation I've laid out already.
    </p>
    <p>
        Food is good, life is great. I'm loving how happy I am.
